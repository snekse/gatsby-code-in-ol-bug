# gatsby-code-in-ol-bug
Demonstrate a gatsby bug when there is a code block in an ordered list.

In actuality, show that it's not a straight-forward gatsby bug, 
but something wrong with our config. 
This repo works perfectly fine on the `master` branch.
I'll add a broken branch when I figure out what's going wrong.



```
gatsby develop
```
